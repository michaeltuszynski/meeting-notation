# Meeting Intelligence Assistant - AI Coding Rules

## Critical Performance Requirements
- EVERY change must maintain <2s end-to-end latency
- Run `npm run perf:check` after modifications

## Environment
- Always use venv Python, not system Python
- Use project Node.js (v20), not system Node
- Run `source activate.sh` before development

## Code Standards
- Use async/await over promises
- Implement streaming/chunking for real-time processing
- Clear audio buffers after processing
- Use Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks

## WebSocket Requirements
- Always handle connection drops gracefully
- Never lose audio data during reconnection
- Implement exponential backoff

## Testing
- Write latency tests for new features
- Test WebSocket reconnection scenarios
