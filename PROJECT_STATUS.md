### 🚀 How to Run

#### Development Mode
```bash
# With Docker (recommended)
npm run docker:dev

# Or directly
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build

# Access at http://localhost:4000
```

#### Production Mode
```bash
npm run docker:prod
# Or
docker-compose up -d
```

### 🔑 Required Environment Variables

Create `.env` file with:
```
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key      # For future GPT-4o Mini integration
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_api_key      # For future knowledge retrieval
```

### 📈 Next Steps (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **GPT-4o Mini Term Extraction** (<500ms latency)
   - Extract key terms and entities from transcripts
   - Batch processing for efficiency
   - Cost: $0.15/1M tokens

2. **Tavily Knowledge Retrieval** (<1000ms latency)
   - Fetch definitions for extracted terms
   - Real-time knowledge augmentation
   - Cost: $10/month for 10K searches

3. **Redis Caching**
   - 24-hour TTL for term definitions
   - Reduce API calls
   - Improve response times

4. **Electron Desktop App**
   - System audio capture via desktopCapturer
   - Cross-platform support
   - Native performance

5. **Platform-Specific Audio**
   - macOS: BlackHole integration
   - Windows: VB-Cable support

### 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

1. **Issue**: Frontend not rendering
   - **Solution**: Fixed by adding webpack build process and DefinePlugin for environment variables

2. **Issue**: No audio transcription despite capture
   - **Solution**: Fixed audio format conversion and byte order for Deepgram compatibility

3. **Issue**: Express v5 path-to-regexp error
   - **Solution**: Simplified routing to avoid wildcard paths

4. **Issue**: Deepgram timeout disconnections
   - **Solution**: Implemented keepalive mechanism every 8 seconds

## Session Summary

This development session successfully implemented the core transcription pipeline for the Meeting Intelligence Assistant. The system now captures audio from the browser, processes it through a backend service, sends it to Deepgram for transcription, and displays real-time results with excellent latency (105-141ms).

The architecture is containerized with Docker, making it easy to deploy and scale. The next phase will add intelligence features through GPT-4o Mini term extraction and Tavily knowledge retrieval to provide real-time context and definitions during meetings.

All code is version controlled and backed up to GitHub for safe rollback if needed.
