### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables
meetings (id, title, description, start_time, end_time, status, participant_count)
transcripts (id, meeting_id, text, is_final, confidence, timestamp)
extracted_terms (id, meeting_id, term, frequency, first_mentioned_at)
term_definitions (id, term, definition, sources, created_at)
meeting_metadata (meeting_id, duration_seconds, word_count, term_count, key_topics, summary)
```

### Frontend Architecture
- **React**: Manual setup without Create React App
- **Socket.io Client**: Real-time WebSocket communication
- **Component Structure**: Modular design with specialized components
  - `App.jsx`: Main application orchestration
  - `MeetingSidebar.jsx`: Meeting navigation and management
  - `ReportView.jsx`: Comprehensive report display (NEW)
  - `DefinitionHistory.jsx`: Full definition history sidebar (NEW)

### Infrastructure
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-service orchestration
- **Development Environment**: Volume mounts for live reload
- **PostgreSQL 15**: Primary database
- **Redis Alpine**: Caching layer
- **Node.js 20.18.0**: Backend runtime
- **Webpack**: Frontend bundling
