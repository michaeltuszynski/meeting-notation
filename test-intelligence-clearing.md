# Intelligence Data Clearing Test Plan

## What Was Implemented

✅ **Backend Intelligence Clearing:**
- When a meeting is deleted → `contextualIntelligence.clearMeeting()` and `gpt4oMiniService.reset()` are called
- When a meeting ends → Both intelligence services are reset  
- When switching meeting context → Services reset before switching
- When transcript is cleared → `transcript:clear` event resets intelligence but keeps meeting context

✅ **Frontend State Clearing:**
- When selecting a different meeting → All intelligence state cleared before loading new data
- When meeting deleted → If it's the active meeting, all data cleared
- When "Clear Transcript" clicked → All transcript and intelligence state cleared
- When `intelligence:reset` event received → All intelligence data cleared

✅ **New Intelligence Service Methods:**
- Added `clearMeeting(meetingId)` to contextual intelligence service
- Maintains proper meeting scoping and context switching

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Delete Active Meeting
1. **Setup:** Start a meeting, record some audio, generate terms/definitions
2. **Action:** Delete the active meeting  
3. **Expected:** All intelligence data (terms, definitions, contextual insights) should disappear from UI
4. **Backend:** Should call `clearMeeting()` and reset services

### Scenario 2: Switch Between Meetings  
1. **Setup:** Have multiple meetings with different terms/definitions
2. **Action:** Switch from Meeting A to Meeting B
3. **Expected:** Meeting A's intelligence data should be replaced with Meeting B's data
4. **Backend:** Should reset services and emit `intelligence:reset`

### Scenario 3: Clear Transcript
1. **Setup:** Active meeting with transcript and extracted terms
2. **Action:** Click "Clear Transcript" button
3. **Expected:** Transcript and all intelligence data cleared, but meeting stays active
4. **Backend:** Should emit `transcript:clear` and reset services

### Scenario 4: End Meeting
1. **Setup:** Active meeting with intelligence data
2. **Action:** End the meeting
3. **Expected:** All intelligence data cleared, meeting becomes inactive
4. **Backend:** Should reset both intelligence services

## Key Implementation Details

- **Meeting Scoping:** Intelligence data is now properly scoped to individual meetings
- **Event-Driven:** Uses Socket.IO events for real-time clearing across frontend/backend
- **State Consistency:** Frontend state always matches backend intelligence service state
- **Memory Management:** Deleted meetings have their intelligence data completely removed from memory

## Files Modified

- `backend/server.js` - Added intelligence clearing to meeting lifecycle events
- `backend/llm/contextual-intelligence.js` - Added `clearMeeting()` method
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Added intelligence clearing to UI actions and events
- `backend/routes/meetings.js` - Enhanced meeting deletion to trigger intelligence clearing

The intelligence data is now properly scoped to meetings and will be cleared when:
- Meeting is deleted
- Meeting is ended  
- Switching between meetings
- Manually clearing transcript
- Receiving backend reset events
